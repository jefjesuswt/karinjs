## Why KarinJS?

KarinJS is a next-generation, enterprise-ready framework for Node.js built on top of Bun. It's designed from the ground up to provide a development experience that is both incredibly fast and easy to maintain.

- **🚀 10x Faster than NestJS:** Leveraging the power of Bun and a highly optimized core, KarinJS delivers unparalleled performance.
- **📦 Module-less Architecture:** Say goodbye to complex module systems. KarinJS uses a simple, intuitive structure that makes your codebase cleaner and easier to reason about.
- **💉 True Dependency Injection:** With `tsyringe`, KarinJS implements a robust and feature-rich dependency injection system, just like in enterprise languages like Java or C#.
- **🔒 Fully Type-Safe:** Written in TypeScript, KarinJS provides a strongly-typed API to catch errors at compile time, not runtime.

## Benchmark

The results speak for themselves. In a head-to-head comparison with NestJS, KarinJS demonstrates a significant performance advantage.

- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, Arch Linux

### Throughput (Requests/Second)

![Throughput Benchmark](./docs/assets/benchmark_throughput.png)
_KarinJS: ~97,609 req/sec | NestJS: ~9,715 req/sec_

### Latency (ms)

![Latency Benchmark](./docs/assets/benchmark_latency.png)
_KarinJS: ~1.01ms | NestJS: ~10.28ms_

> **Results:** KarinJS handles 10x more requests per second than NestJS, with a latency of minus 10x.

## Installation

Get started with KarinJS by installing the core packages:

```bash
bun add @karinjs/core @karinjs/platform-h3 reflect-metadata tsyringe
```

## Quick Start

Create a fully functional HTTP server in just a few lines of code.

**1. Create your controller**

`src/users.controller.ts`

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from "@karinjs/core";

@Controller("/users")
export class UsersController {
  @Get("/")
  getUsers() {
    return [{ id: 1, name: "John Doe" }];
  }

  @Get("/:id")
  getUser(id: string) {
    return { id, name: `User ${id}` };
  }
}
```

**2. Bootstrap the application**

`src/main.ts`

```typescript
import "reflect-metadata";
import { KarinFactory } from "@karinjs/core";
import { H3Adapter } from "@karinjs/platform-h3";
import { UsersController } from "./users.controller";

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await KarinFactory.create(H3Adapter, {
    controllers: [UsersController],
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("🦊 KarinJS server running on http://localhost:3000");
  });
}

bootstrap();
```

**3. Run the server**

```bash
bun run src/main.ts
```
